    A sorted array is always a minHeap, but vice versa is not true
    A sorted array in decreasing order is always a maxHeap

    bst to heap array - travel inorder and add elements to array

    bst to maxHeap tree - reverse inorder traversal in bst and store in array, put elements in bst by level order traversal

    bst to maxHeap tree - reverse inorder traversal in bst and store in array, put elements in bst by preorder traversal

    we can do it by post order also
