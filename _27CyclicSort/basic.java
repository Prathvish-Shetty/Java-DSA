    given an array of length n. with numbers 0 to n, 1 to n, 0 to n-1
    find duplicate or missing number

    algorithm:
        n length : 0 to n-1 : each element appearing once

    in each swap atleast one element goes to its right place
    TC = O(n)

    what is the worst number of swaps in cyclic sort for length n
